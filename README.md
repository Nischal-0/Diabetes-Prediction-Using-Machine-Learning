## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent complications. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict diabetes based on medical data, aiming to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes medical diagnostic measurements such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more. [Include a link to the dataset if itâ€™s publicly available, or mention where it was obtained.]

## Algorithms Used

The project explores several machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

## Setup

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. The recommended way is to use a virtual environment.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nischal-0/diabetes-prediction.git
    cd diabetes-prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis and predictions:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open `Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques.ipynb` and run the cells to see the results.

## Results

The results of the predictions will be displayed in the notebook, including accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics for each algorithm.
